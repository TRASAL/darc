Data Analysis of Real-\/time Candidates from A\+R\+TS

master\+: \href{https://travis-ci.com/loostrum/darc}{\texttt{ }}

dev\+: \href{https://travis-ci.com/loostrum/darc}{\texttt{ }}

This repository contains the necessary software to automatically process F\+RB candidates produced by the A\+R\+TS real-\/time system. The main executable should only be run on the A\+R\+TS cluster.

\subsubsection*{Branches}

Note\+: I\+AB modes also support processing the central T\+AB.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item master\+: Offline, T\+AB mode processing.
\item dev\+: Development of real-\/time processing
\item test\+\_\+trigger\+: Directly apply thresholds to A\+M\+B\+ER triggers to test I\+Q\+UV triggering (I\+AB).
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Overview}

D\+A\+RC comprises several parts that communicate through either queues or sockets. The availability of different services depends on which branch is active.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item D\+A\+R\+C\+Master\+: Master service. Handles communication with user, controls all other services.
\item A\+M\+B\+E\+R\+Listener\+: Continuously reads A\+M\+B\+ER triggers and puts them on a Python queue (for clustering or direct triggering).
\item A\+M\+B\+E\+R\+Clustering\+: Clusters A\+M\+B\+ER triggers together and puts them on D\+A\+DA trigger queue.
\item A\+M\+B\+E\+R\+Triggering\+: Directly applies thresholds to A\+M\+B\+ER triggers and puts triggers on V\+O\+Event queue.
\item D\+A\+D\+A\+Trigger\+: Generates and send dada\+\_\+dbevent triggers for stokes I and I\+Q\+UV
\item V\+O\+Event\+Generator\+: Converts incoming trigger to V\+O\+Event and sends it.
\item Status\+Website\+: Queries status of all services and generates status webpage.
\item Offline\+Procesing\+: Handles offline processing for 12 T\+A\+Bs / I\+AB.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsubsection*{Executables}

{\ttfamily darc}\+: Used to interact with the all services through the D\+A\+RC Master service.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+start\+\_\+master}\+: Starts the D\+A\+RC Master service if not already running.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+stop\+\_\+master}\+: Stops the D\+A\+RC Master service and by extension all other services.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+start\+\_\+all\+\_\+services}\+: Starts all services, including D\+A\+RC Master if it is not running.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+stop\+\_\+all\+\_\+services}\+: Stops all services except D\+A\+RC Master.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+kill\+\_\+all}\+: Kill D\+A\+RC Master service and by extension all other services.\textbackslash{} {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+service}\+: The D\+A\+RC Master service. Should not be started directly, but through {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+start\+\_\+master} or {\ttfamily darc\+\_\+start\+\_\+all\+\_\+services}
