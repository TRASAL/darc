Welcome to DARC's documentation
===============================
DARC (Data Analysis of Real-time Candidates) is the real-time processing pipeline of the
Apertif Radio Transient System (ARTS). DARC consists of several services, that each execute
a subset of the pipeline. There are two main modes of operation: real-time and offline.
Both modes can run at the same time.
